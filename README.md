## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I used my knowledge of flexbox which helped me in centering the card and also the images and text

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  display:flex;
  justify-content:center;
  align-items:center;
}
```
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I want to focus on projects that has to do with Javascript DOM and frontend libraries esp React.
### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This helped me for the layout reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox,Grid and media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
